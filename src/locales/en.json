  "V1C5L1": "Fossil fuels",

  "V1C7L1": "CO2 emissions",
  "V1C7L2": "CO2 is the first anthropogenic greenhouse gas (i.e. emitted by humans). CO2 emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.",

  "V1C8L2": "Agriculture is responsible for emitting a little CO2 and a lot of methane (cows, rice fields), and nitrous oxide (fertilizers). All in all, it represents 25% of GHG emissions if deforestation is included.",
  "V1C9L1": "Other GHGs",
  "V1C9L2": "CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas. There are also methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (which come mostly from agriculture), as well as a few others.",
